Installation
Make sure you have MelonLoader installed on your game
Download the Backpack.dll file
Place it in the Mods folder of your installation
Launch the game and press B to open your new backpack!

Usage Tips
Use the backpack to store less frequently used items, keeping your hotbar free for essential tools
Contents are preserved even if you quit the game, so feel free to store important items
To quickly move items, hold Shift while clicking on an item to transfer it between the backpack and your hotbar
Drag and drop also works for moving items around
