**Also available on:**
- [Nexusmods](https://www.nexusmods.com/schedule1/mods/107?tab=description)

Features
Portable Storage Solution ‚Äì Carry extra items with you anywhere in the game.
Persistent Saving ‚Äì Backpack contents are now saved between game sessions.
Easy Access ‚Äì Open the backpack with a single keypress (default is B, configurable via a config.ini file).
Fixed Layout ‚Äì Always organized in a 4√ó3 grid (12 slots); saved data is remapped to fit this layout.
Seamless Integration ‚Äì Uses the game‚Äôs native storage UI.
Lightweight Implementation ‚Äì Minimal impact on performance.


Installation
Ensure MelonLoader is installed on your game.
Download the BackpackMod.dll file.
Place the DLL in your Schedule I Mods folder:
(Optional) Adjust the key binding by editing the config.ini file located in the ‚ÄúBackpackMod‚Äù folder (which is automatically created next to the DLL).
Launch the game.


Usage Guide
Toggle Backpack: Press the configured key (default: B) to open or close the backpack interface.
Item Management: Drag and drop items between your main inventory and the backpack.
A warning notification may appear when you open the backpack regarding the persistence of data.


Known Issues
Global Saving: The backpack is not unique per player; it is global. In multiplayer, only the host‚Äôs backpack data is saved.
Slot Remapping: If the saved slot count does not match the fixed 4√ó3 layout, the mod will remap slots. Only the first 12 slots are preserved.
Multiplayer Limitations: The mod is primarily designed for single-player or host-controlled multiplayer scenarios.

Developer: Tugakit & Bread-chan
